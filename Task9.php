<!-- 9. Form and function
In this challenge, youâ€™ll use the function that you created in the last challenge.
 Create two PHP files. One will have a form with two fields for width and height and a submit button.
  The form should use the POST method and submit to the second PHP file, which will output HTML and the result
   of the function in an H1 tag. -->

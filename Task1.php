<!-- 1. Create a hello world page
For this challenge, create a PHP page with standard HTML,
including head, title, and body tags. Since one feature of PHP is the ability to embed it in HTML,
this will give you some practice doing that. Inside the body tag, create an H1 tag that contains a PHP
section that prints out “Hello World.”
